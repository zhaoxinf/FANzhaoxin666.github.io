## About Me
 I am now working at Carnegie Mellon University, supervised by Prof. [Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/). I received my bachelor's degree from China University of Petroleum.  I also have a great time researching computer vision at ByteDance, Neal, Psyai and DeepGLInt.  My research interests lie in the area of computer vision and machine learning. I have been long working on place recognition, 6D pose estimation and human body reconstruction. Feel free to send me an email if you are interested in my research.
