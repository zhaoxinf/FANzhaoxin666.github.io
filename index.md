## About Me
I am a PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science, supervised by Prof. [Kai Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~kaichen/) at HKUST. Additionally, I am a scholar at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working with Prof [Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/group/). I also serve as the director of the  [Psyche.AI AVATAR Lab](https://www.psyai.com/home).

My dream is to use technology to change the world. Specifically, I hope to build robots and digital humans that are indistinguishable from real humans, with the goal of achieving artificial general intelligence. Prior to joining HKUST, I was a PhD student at Renmin University of China, co-supervised by Prof. [Jun He](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/jsky/szdw/ajxjgcx/jsjkxyjsx1/js2/758fdda1a0354792847b9e69d1289f6f.htm) from RUC and Prof. [Hongyan Liu](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1210/32067.htm) from Tsinghua University (THU). Additionally, I have worked as a researcher at ByteDance, Neal, and DeepGLInt, focusing on computer vision research.

My research interests lie in the areas of computer vision and machine learning, specifically in place recognition, 6D pose estimation, human body reconstruction, and medical image segmentation. Please feel free to contact me by email if you are interested in my research.
